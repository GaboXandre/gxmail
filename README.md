## Interactive Mode

If called without arguments, *gxmail* will run in interactive mode.

## Batch mode 

    [-b FILE.TXT --batch FILE.TXT]
In batch mode, *gxmail* will read a list recepients from a text file.
*Notes:*
* The file must be plain text and contain one email per line
* *batch mode* is NOT compatible with *interactive mode*, you must provide arguments: to, subject, and message. Only the profile may be ommitted, in which case, the default profile is used.

*Spam is illegal, and it means you are evil if you use this software for that purpose.*

# Profiles

## First Run
When you first run *gxmail.py* it will prompt you to create your default profile:
```
 You don't have a profile set up yet. Let's do it now!
 Server -> smtp.mydomain.com
 Port -> 25
 Your email -> myemail@mydomain.com
 Your password -> myPa$$w0rd
 You are ready to send emails with your new profile!
```
## Profile Management
Each profile is stored as a text file inside *~/.gxmail*
You can simply delete each file to remove a profile.
It is also posible to edit them with your favorite text editor, just remember to keep the structure:

    ["Profilename", "server", "port", "email", "password"]

Example:

    ["default", "smtp.mydomain.com", "25", "myemail@mydomain.com", "myPa$$w0rd"]
